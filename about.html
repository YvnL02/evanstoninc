                <p>Evanston Pharma Inc was founded in 2003 and rebranded as
                    Evanstoninc LLC in 2012. It initially focused on API sales and
                    recently shifted its focus to consulting and preparation
                    product entry into the US market. The company has helped
                    numerous Chinese companies to gain FDA approval and
                    establish sales for their API products. Additionally, two
                    Chinese companies have successfully entered the US market
                    with their preparation products, with stable sales, through
                    Evanstoninc's agency. One of these companies is a publicly
                    listed firm in Zhejiang, while the other is based in Jiangsu.
                    There is also a Zhejiang-based listed company with a product
                    awaiting FDA on-site inspection and a completed sales
                    contract.</p>
